Includes exploration in Machine Learning with 

- Ensemble learning

- KNN

- Poisson Regression

- Multiple Linear Regression

- Ordinal Regression

Prequisites
-----------

- R x64 

- RStudio

Explanation of files
--------

There is no execution needed to run anything, as the full PDF of the Rmd file is provided called `Project.pdf` (the Rmd file is still provided for convenience). This PDF contains all code used to run the models using the datasets provided. A description of each dataset follows.

  1. The file `rawdata.xlsx`is not to be used but is placed there to show the format of the original data.
  2. `Crystalr.csv` was used for Poisson Regression and KNN
  3. `Crystalk.csv` was used for MLR and Ordinal Regression
